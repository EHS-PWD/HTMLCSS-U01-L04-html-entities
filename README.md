### Unit 01 - Lesson 4: Working with HTML Entities

#### **Objective:**

After learning about HTML entities, students will extend their previous HTML document to include various HTML entities. This assignment will demonstrate their understanding of how to display special characters like less than, greater than, ampersands, and more using HTML entities.

### **Step-by-Step Guide:**

1. **Open Your Existing HTML Document:**

   - [ ] Open the `index.html` file you created in Lessons 1 - 3.

2. **Add Special Characters Using HTML Entities:**

   - [ ] Inside the `<body>` tag, add the following content before the `<script>` tag to practice using HTML entities:
     ```html
     <h2>Using Special Characters</h2>
     <p>
       You can use HTML entities to display special characters like less than
       (&lt;), greater than (&gt;), ampersand (&amp;), copyright (&copy;),
       non-breaking space (&nbsp;), and double quotation marks (&quot;).
     </p>
     ```

3. **Add More Examples of Entities in Separate Paragraphs:**

   - [ ] Below the paragraph you just added, include additional paragraphs explaining and displaying more HTML entities:
     ```html
     <p>The less than symbol is represented as: &lt;</p>
     <p>The greater than symbol is represented as: &gt;</p>
     <p>The ampersand symbol is represented as: &amp;</p>
     <p>The copyright symbol is represented as: &copy;</p>
     <p>To create a non-breaking space, use: &nbsp;</p>
     <p>Double quotation marks are represented as: &quot;</p>
     ```

4. **Save Your Work:**

   - [ ] Save the file as `index.html`.

5. **Test Your HTML Document:**

   - [ ] Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
   - [ ] Verify that the special characters are displayed correctly using the corresponding HTML entities.

6. **Submit Your Work:**
   - [ ] Once you’ve confirmed that the special characters are correctly displayed, submit the updated `index.html` file to the class assignment folder or through the school’s learning management system.

### **Assessment Criteria:**

- Correct usage of HTML entities to display special characters.
- Proper structure and syntax of the HTML document.
